# Stop n Wait Protocol

AIM: Implementation of Stop and Wait Protocol

## ALGORITHM:

Sender:

    Step1: sequence ÃŸ 0
    Step2: Accept new packet and assign sequence to it.
    Step3: Send packet sequence with sequence number sequence.
    Step4: Set timer for recently sent packets.
    Step5: If error free acknowledgment from receiver and NextFrameExpected -> sequence then sequence -> NextFrameExpected.
    Step6: If time out then go to step3.
    Step7: Stop.

Receiver:

    Step1: Start.
    Step2: NextFrameExpected <- 0, repeat steps 3 forever.
    Step3: If error-free frame received and sequence= NextFrameExpected, then pass packet to higher layer and NextFrameExpected <- NextFrameExpected+1(modulo 2).
    Step4: Stop.
